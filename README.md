## Part 1: Business Problem, Importing the Data, and Exploring the Data

In this ML project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate flight ticket prices. The ability to forecast ticket prices can significantly benefit both customers and the airline industry. For travelers, it provides an estimation of the cost, allowing them to plan their trips more effectively. For airlines, it helps with pricing strategies, revenue management, and understanding customer behavior.

To begin, we will import the necessary flight ticket data. This dataset will include various features such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airline carriers, flight durations, and other relevant factors that may influence ticket prices.

The initial phase will also involve exploring the data to gain insights into its structure and quality. We will perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and possibly transform some features to make the data suitable for analysis and model building.

## Part 2: EDA, Feature Engineering and Analytics

In this stage, we will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (flight ticket prices). Visualization techniques will be employed to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within the data.

Feature Engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's performance. We will derive new features from existing ones, encode categorical variables, and normalize or scale numerical features to ensure that they are optimal for model training.

Additionally, we will perform analytics on the data, such as finding correlations between different attributes and analyzing the impact of different factors on ticket prices. These insights will guide us in selecting the most relevant features for building the model.

## Part 3: Building the ML Model, Validating the Model

In this final phase, we will construct a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict flight ticket prices based on the selected features. Various regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression, will be explored to find the most suitable model with high predictive performance.

The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. We will use evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

To further enhance the model's robustness, we may employ techniques like Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter tuning. This ensures that the model is not overfitting and can generalize well on new, unseen data.

By the end of this project, we expect to have a reliable and accurate ML model that can predict flight ticket prices for given input parameters. This model can be used by travel websites, airlines, or customers to plan and make informed decisions regarding air travel.
